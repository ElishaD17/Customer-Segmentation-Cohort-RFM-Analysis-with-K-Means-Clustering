# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
 ![mv](gg.webp)
 
### Overview

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their spending habits and annual income. The dataset used for this analysis includes customer demographic and spending data.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
   - Handle missing values and perform necessary data cleaning.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize the distribution of age, annual income, and spending score.
   - Use histograms, box plots, and pair plots to understand the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features or transform existing ones if necessary.

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Apply K-Means clustering to segment the customers.
   - Analyze and interpret the clusters.

5. **Visualization of Clusters**
   - Use scatter plots to visualize the clusters.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Usage

1. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Run the google colab Notebook:**

   Open the `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook and run all cells to perform the clustering analysis and visualize the results.

### Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to use K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. By analyzing the clusters, businesses can better understand their customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
